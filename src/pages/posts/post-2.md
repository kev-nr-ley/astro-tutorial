# What a cool city.

I love Seoul. It's a beautiful city with so much to do and see. The people are friendly, the food is delicious, and there's always something going on. I've been living here for over two years now and I still find new things to explore every day. It's a great place to live!

## Seoul is a city of contrasts.

It's a city of contrasts. There are skyscrapers and traditional Korean houses, modern shopping malls and street markets, high-end restaurants and food stalls on every corner. You can find anything you want in Seoul!
